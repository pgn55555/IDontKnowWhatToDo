# "I don't know what to do" button

> automatic translation

**Imagine the situation:** you arrive at a hotel where there is a washing machine in the room. You need to wash things, and you go to the technique. There are a lot of buttons and modes on it so it's hard to figure it out. At this point, people are divided into three types: some take their clothes to the laundry, others go to deal with the instructions, and someone simply refuses to wash. However, there is a simple solution. 

**The "I do not know what to do" button** is the standard of a technically complex product, implying a button, pressing which triggers the mode most suitable in an average situation.

For example, for *washing machine* it can be a daily washing mode.
